          My name is Joanna technically known as <em><b>DevBytes</b></em
          >. Ive always had a passion for the software world basically computer
          science.... although i wasnt opportuned to embrace that passion until
          this year, and so far the jounrney hasnt been so smooth afterall
          <em>"nothing good comes easy"</em> and at times i felt like giving up
          one of the resons being that i was just watching videos and so when im
          stuck id just have to watch more videos which i believe we all can
          believe is <em>boring</em> but thankfully that is where
          <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/">ALT School</a> came in and
          everything started falling in place little by little because we have
          live classes where we are able to ask questions, we have people who
          are on the same track as ours and so we are able to work together to
          get things done and then there are also learning circles which makes
          it easier for one to mingle and so far id say that if i didnt see the
          light that was at the end of the tunnel before i certainly do now. It
          has been quite worthwhile although ive only made one reliable friend
          David oladejo aka <b>"PresiDO"</b> i believe there would be more to
          come in the future. Please feel free to join us in this amazing
          journey by filling your <a href="form">Form</a> right here....your
          highly <b>WELCOME !!!!</b>

          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
          Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
          through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
          undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
          1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
          Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
          theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
          of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
          section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the
          1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
          1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
          reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
          versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham Contrary to popular
